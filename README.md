#### Overview
	Bang is an attempt at simplifying a completely asynchronous web application MVC
	environment that utilizes ExtJS 4.  This application stack does not refresh, but rather
	exploits powerful dynamic features of code injection through ajax and websockets.

#### Features
    -  Jade for a robust, elegant, feature rich template engine
    -  Stylus for an expressive, dynamic and robust CSS
    -  Mongoose for a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
    -  Socket.io for realtime transport mechanisms
    
#### Requires
	-  NodeJS 0.6.6
	-  MongoDB 2.0.2
	-  ExtJS 4.0.7 (place it inside ./client)
